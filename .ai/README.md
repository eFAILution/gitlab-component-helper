# .ai/ Directory

Structured documentation for AI coding assistants using [AI Context as Code (AICaC)](https://github.com/eFAILution/AICaC).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `context.yaml` | Project overview, tech stack, dependencies |
| `architecture.yaml` | Components, relationships, data flow |
| `workflows.yaml` | Common development tasks and commands |
| `decisions.yaml` | Architectural decisions and rationale |
| `errors.yaml` | Common errors and solutions |

## For AI Assistants

**Read order:**
1. `context.yaml` - Start here for project overview
2. `workflows.yaml` - How to build, test, and develop
3. `architecture.yaml` - Code structure and components
4. `errors.yaml` - If debugging issues

**Load only what you need:**
- Adding feature → `workflows.yaml`
- Understanding architecture → `architecture.yaml`
- Fixing error → `errors.yaml`
- Project setup → `context.yaml`

## For Humans

These are human-readable YAML files documenting the project structure. See `../README.md` for end-user documentation.
