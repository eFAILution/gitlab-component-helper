# GitHub Actions Release Workflow (DISABLED to avoid costs)
#
# This workflow has been disabled to prevent GitHub Actions costs.
# Use local release scripts instead:
#   - npm run release:manual (fully manual, no dependencies)
#   - npm run release:local-only (semantic-release without GitHub)
#
# To re-enable this workflow, remove the comments and the 'if: false' condition below.
